- Currently a graduate student at the [Department of Statistics](http://en.stat.huji.ac.il/) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) and research scientist at [Metrum Research Group](https://www.metrumrg.com/). Previously worked as statistician in the Research Department of the [Bank of Israel](http://www.boi.org.il/en/Pages/Default.aspx), [Matrix](http://www.matrix.co.il/en/Pages/default.aspx) and a consultant to the [Van Leer Jerusalem Institute](http://www.vanleer.org.il/en).

- Obtained a BA in Economics and Statistics and an MA in Statistics from HUJI (Supervised by [Ya'acov Ritov](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yritov/jr.html)). My masters thesis dissertation involved creating a [nowcasting model for the Gross Domestic Product of Israel via regularized regression models](http://www.boi.org.il/deptdata/mehkar/papers/dp1016e.pdf) during my time as a research student in the Bank of Israel.

- Stats research interests include high dimensional regression problems, where there are more covariates than observations, and combining surveillance techniques with copulas to track long tailed events. 

- Right now heavily focused on R, but equally lingual in SAS (incl IML), Matlab, STATA, EViews, and VB.

- Enjoy integrating different languages with R like JavaScript and C++, to improve workflows.
