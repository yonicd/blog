- Stats research interests include high dimensional regression problems, where there are more covariates than observations, and combining surveillance techniques with copulas to track long tailed events. 

- Right now heavily focused on R, but equally lingual in SAS (incl IML), Matlab, STATA, EViews, and VB.

- Enjoy integrating different languages with R like JavaScript and C++, to improve workflows.
