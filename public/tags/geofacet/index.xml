      <description>I have been trying to decipher for myself, what is in the current (well, yesterday&amp;rsquo;s) Graham-Cassidy health care bill. I saw this image on many news outlets a few days ago and my inner hate for pie charts bubbled up.
This is a zoom in on the pie chart &amp;hellip; From what I can gather, these figures are attempting to say that there are specific states that are getting relatively more of the federal health care funds under the Afordable Care Act (ACA) than their relative state population.</description>
